# alt921-scraper
A web scraper to get the current song playing on ALT 92.1 and make a playlist of it (eventually)

This python script polls the xml file published by the web player for ALT 92.1 every 100 seconds to build a list of all the songs played on the station over a day. That list will then eventually be used to create a Spotify playlist that I can listen to without ads or Coldplay (because I hate Coldplay)...
